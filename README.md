# Summary of my projects
Below are brief descriptions and links to a selection of data science and optimization projects that I've completed.

<b>1. Image classifier </b> https://github.com/natetsang/ImageClassificationML

In this project, I develop an image classifier in Python from a dataset of roughly 1500 images in 20 categories. I identify over 15 key features and explore several ML models including logistic regression, KNN, SVM, and random forest. The performance of each model was assessed by testing on a separate zipfile of images. Test results indicate that models were roughly X% accurate, which is reasonable given no neural networks were used.
